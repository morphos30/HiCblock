# HiCblock: TAD-free analysis of architectural proteins and insulators

**Overview**

Here, we propose a TAD-free model to directly estimate the blocking effects of architectural proteins, insulators and DNA motifs
on long-range contacts, making the model intuitive and biologically meaningful. In addition, the model allows analyzing the whole Hi-C information content (2D information) instead of only focusing on TAD borders (1D information).
